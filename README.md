# npm-publish-slsa-two-steps

This lab repository demonstrates how to create provenance without using the npm CLI and publish a package to npmjs.com with an attached provenance file (not generated by the npm CLI). This lab was conducted to ensure compatibility with changesets and the external provenance mechanism, even if the package is not directly pushed to npmjs.com.

Here is a table of all GitHub workflows in this repository:
